I regularly tried to solve GO tasks on the Exercism platform. Because I wanted to learn the basics of programming in this language, although GO is used for quite complex tasks (there is even an implementation of the Ethereum protocol in GO). However, it is quite easy to learn it at the initial stage. Because it lacks some of the features of object-oriented programming, it lacks classes and class-based inheritance. In addition, it allows you to easily scale applications and concurrent programming, although I did not use these functionalities.
